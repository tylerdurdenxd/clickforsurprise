## My Birthday Wish for You

Nikitha, you are my everything. As I look ahead, I see a beautiful future with you by my side. I can't wait for the day when we will spend the rest of our lives together. You are my soulmate, and I am excited for all the adventures and milestones we will share. I am so grateful for every moment we spend together, and I look forward to creating many more beautiful memories with you. You deserve the world, and I am committed to giving you all the love and happiness you can handle.

### At last I would like to say you
You keep on asking "Why am I so special? What have I done to you? --- I'm not that worth!". Well I got a reasonable answer to it.
You are special to me in so many ways that it's hard to put into words. You are worth more than you realize, and I am endlessly grateful to have you in my life.

Sometimes I thought "Why have I loved her so much? Why not someone else?". The I realised that "Why not her? Why someone else?". There are certain questions that exists in the universe that can't be explained but can be felt. It's same such scenario.

### It had been more than 8 years and my love towards you haven't changed yet.Even though if it was 80 years my love towards you never ends. Even If You Dump Me :)

> In my world full of darkness you are spark that makes my world brighter!

### There are many things I have done in past that had hurted you and I ensure it won't happen again.

### One Fine Day
>Imagine it's the year 2030, and it's cloudy and about to rain outside outside. We are inside our room, withthe AC creating the perfect temperature. Wrapped up together under a warm, blanket, we lie side by side on the bed, our bodies close and our hearts even closer.Your head rests gently on my arms, and I can feel your breath. My fingers lingering for a moment, feeling the softness of your skin. The smell of rain mixed with the scent of you creating a perfect blend of romance.
In a Dark Room only You And Me watching our favorite series, anime, or movie plays no matter what it is but it's your presence that holds my attention.
Cuddling, liplocks, fuc........ just you and me........
The world outside fades away, and in this perfect moment, it's just you and me, wrapped up in love and warmth, creating memories that we'll stay forever.

## Will You Be My Better Half?
### I Just Wanna be Yours
Happy Birthday, my love! 🎂🎁🎈

With Love,

Kumaran S
